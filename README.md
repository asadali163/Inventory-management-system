*Description:  The InventoryUI class serves as the graphical user interface (GUI) for our Inventory Management System. It encapsulates the interface elements, such as buttons, input fields, and tables, facilitating interaction with the inventory data. Through its methods and attributes, InventoryUI orchestrates the display of inventory items, addition, deletion, and modification operations, ensuring a seamless user experience.*

*The Inventory class lies at the heart of our system, functioning as the repository for managing inventory-related data. It maintains collections of items, such as itemList, itemDeque, and itemSet, offering various data structures for storage and retrieval. Through methods like addItem, updateItem, and deleteItem, Inventory provides functionalities for manipulating inventory items. Additionally, it interfaces with the database via initializeDatabase and fetchDataFromDatabase methods to ensure persistent storage and retrieval of inventory data.*

### Item Class Diagram

*Description: The Item class represents individual items within our inventory system. It encapsulates attributes such as ID, name, quantity, and price, defining the core properties of each inventory item. Through getter and setter methods, Item enables access to and modification of its attributes, ensuring data integrity and encapsulation principles. With its constructor and initialization methods, Item facilitates the creation and initialization of item objects with specific properties.*

### FileManager Class Diagram

*The FileManager class plays a crucial role in our system, providing functionalities for managing data persistence. It offers methods like saveToFile and loadFromFile, facilitating the storage and retrieval of inventory data from external files. By encapsulating file operations, FileManager abstracts away the complexities of file handling, ensuring seamless integration with the rest of the system. Through its robust error handling and feedback mechanisms, FileManager ensures data integrity and reliability in data storage and retrieval operations.*


# Part 2 â€“ Linear Data Structures

In this part of the project, we've enhanced our software to incorporate linear data structures, providing additional flexibility and efficiency in managing inventory data. Here's what we've done:

- **Added a Deque Structure**: We've integrated a Deque (double-ended queue) from the Java API to support efficient insertion and deletion operations at both ends of the queue. This allows us to implement features such as displaying items in the order they were added and quickly accessing the most recently added items.

- **Implemented a LinkedList**: To store inventory items, we've implemented our own LinkedList data structure. This custom LinkedList offers dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion of elements, ensuring optimal performance for managing inventory data.

- **Utilized Set and Map Structures**: We've leveraged Set and Map structures from the Java API for managing unique items and associating items with unique identifiers, respectively. Sets ensure that each item is stored only once, preventing duplicates in our inventory data. Maps allow us to efficiently retrieve and manipulate items based on their unique identifiers, enhancing data retrieval and update operations.

By incorporating these linear data structures, our software is now more robust, scalable, and efficient, providing enhanced capabilities for inventory management tasks.

We've committed all necessary updates to our GitHub repository and updated the description page to reflect these enhancements. Additionally, we're actively participating in any posted Blackboard activities related to this part of the Major Assignment.


# Part 3 â€“ Trees, Graphs, and Hashing

In this phase of the project, we've further expanded the functionality of our inventory management software by integrating advanced data structures such as trees, graphs, and hashing. Here's a summary of the key enhancements:

- **Efficient Binary Search Tree**: We've implemented an efficient binary search tree (BST) to facilitate quick searching through our inventory data. The BST ensures logarithmic time complexity for search operations, enabling rapid retrieval of items based on specified criteria such as ID or name. This enhances the overall performance and efficiency of our inventory management system.

- **Custom Hash Table Structure**: To optimize data retrieval and storage, we've developed a custom hash table structure tailored to our inventory management needs. The hash table employs a hashing function to map keys (e.g., item IDs) to corresponding values (e.g., item objects), allowing for constant-time access to items based on their unique identifiers. This implementation ensures efficient handling of large datasets and minimizes search times, contributing to improved system responsiveness.

- **Weighted Graph Representation**: Additionally, we've introduced a weighted graph representation to model relationships between inventory items. This graph structure can be utilized to visualize connections or dependencies between items, facilitating advanced analytics and decision-making processes. Whether it's identifying optimal routes for inventory transportation or analyzing item associations, the weighted graph adds a new dimension to our inventory management capabilities.

By incorporating these advanced data structures, our software becomes even more versatile, robust, and scalable, empowering users with enhanced capabilities for managing and analyzing inventory data.

We've committed all necessary updates to our GitHub repository and updated the description page to reflect these enhancements. Moreover, we're actively participating in any posted Blackboard activities related to this part of the Major Assignment.

# Part 4 â€“ System Level Improvements

In this phase of the project, we've introduced significant system-level improvements to enhance the functionality and efficiency of our inventory management software. Here's an overview of the key enhancements:

- **Database Integration with JDBC**: Leveraging Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), we've seamlessly integrated our inventory management software with external databases. By implementing database access methods in the `Inventory` class, we ensure persistent storage and retrieval of inventory data. This enhancement enhances the scalability and reliability of our system, facilitating efficient management of large datasets and seamless integration with existing database systems.

- **Efficient Binary Search Tree**: To optimize search operations within our inventory data, we've implemented an efficient binary search tree (BST) in the `Inventory` class. By organizing inventory items in a binary search tree structure, we enable fast and efficient searching based on item IDs. This enhancement improves search performance and ensures quick retrieval of inventory items, enhancing overall system efficiency.

- **Hash Table Implementation**: In addition to the binary search tree, we've implemented a custom hash table structure for efficient data storage and retrieval. The hash table, implemented in the `Inventory` class, utilizes hashing algorithms to map item attributes to unique hash codes, enabling fast access and retrieval of inventory items. This enhancement enhances data organization and ensures quick access to inventory data, contributing to improved system performance.

- **Additional Improvements**: We've made further enhancements to our software, such as [insert your chosen improvement here]. This enhancement further enhances the functionality or usability of our inventory management software, providing additional value to users.

By implementing these system-level improvements, our software becomes more robust, scalable, and efficient, meeting the evolving needs of businesses and users. We've committed all necessary updates to our GitHub repository and updated the description page to reflect these enhancements. Moreover, we're actively participating in any posted Blackboard activities related to this part of the Major Assignment.
